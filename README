NAME
    Handel - Simple commerce framework with AxKit/TT2 support

DESCRIPTION
    Handel is a quick and not-so-dirty ecommerce framework with AxKit taglib
    support and TT2 (template Toolkit) support. It was started for the
    conversion of an IIS/ASP based commerce site to Apache/ModPerl, but I
    decided that is might be useful to others so here it is on CPAN.

    For the curious, Handel is German for commerce.

REQUIREMENTS
  Prerequisites
    The following modules are required for Handel to work properly. Older
    versions may work fine. For now, these are the versions I have installed
    and verified to work correctly.

    Class::DBI 0.96+
    DBI version 1.36+
    Error 0.14+
    Locale::Maketext 1.06+
    UUID*/GUID
        At least one of the following modules are required to create uuids:
        UUID 0.02, Win32::Guidgen 0.04, Win32API::GUID 0.02, or Data::UUID
        0.10.

    Axit 1.6.2+
        "AxKit" is only required if you plan on using "Handel" within XSP
        using the supplied taglibs.

  Optional Modules
    The following modules are required for Handel to run, although some
    features may be unavailable without the:

    Locale::Currency::Format
        When present, this module allows all prices to be formatted to
        specific currency codes and formats.

    The following modules are only required for the test suite:

    Test::More 0.48+
        The "Test::More" included with perl 5.8.4 and "Test::More" <= 0.48
        have issues with ithreads that usually cause crashes in "Class::DBI"
        tests.

    Pod::Coverage 0.14+
        The pod coverage tests may fail complaining about missing pod for
        methods if Pod::Coverage < 0.14 is installed. This is due to certain
        syntax variations of the pod with escaped gt/lt. I may just alter
        the pod and bump this version down if there is enough feedback to do
        so.

    Test::Pod 1.00+
        "Test::Pod" 1.00 added the "all_pod_files_ok()" method which makes
        my life easier. :-)

    Test::Pod::Coverage 1.04+
        "Test::Pod::Coverage" 1.04 was made taint safe, and we run the tests
        with -wT like good girls and boys.
