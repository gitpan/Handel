NAME
    Handel - Simple commerce framework with AxKit/TT2 support

DESCRIPTION
    Handel is a quick and not-so-dirty ecommerce framework with the AxKit
    manpage taglib support and TT2 (template Toolkit) support. It was
    started for the conversion of an IIS/ASP based commerce site to
    Apache/ModPerl, but I decided that is might be useful to others so here
    it is on CPAN.

    For the curious, Handel is German for commerce.

REQUIREMENTS
  Prerequisites

    The following modules are required for Handel to work properly. Older
    versions may work fine, but hese are the versions I have installed and
    verified to work correctly. IF you have older versious and all tests
    pass, send me an email and I'll lower the version requirements.

    Class::DBI
        "Class::DBI" version 0.96 or greater.

    DBI "DBI" version 1.36 or greater.

    Error
        "Error" version 0.14 or greater.

    Locale::Maketext
        "Locale::Maketext" version 1.06 or greater.

    Data::UUID
        At least one of the following modules are required to create uuids:
        "UUID" 0.02, "Win32::Guidgen" 0.04, "Win32API::GUID" 0.02, or
        "Data::UUID" 0.10.

  Optional Modules

    The following modules are not required for Handel to run, although some
    features may be unavailable without them.

    AxKit
        "AxKit" version 1.61 or greater.

        "AxKit" is only required if you plan on using "Handel" within XSP
        using the supplied taglibs.

    Locale::Currency::Format
        "Locale::Currency::Format" version 1.22 or greater.

        When present, this module allows all prices to be formatted to
        specific currency codes and formats.

    Finance::Currency::Convert::WebserviceX
        "Finance::Currency::Convert::WebserviceX" version 0.03 or greater.

        When present, this module allows all prices to be converted from one
        currency to another.

    Locale::Currency
        "Locale::Currency" version 2.07 or greater.

        When present, this module allows all conversion and currency codes
        to be verified as real 3 letter ISO currency codes.

    Template
        "Template" version 2.07 or greater.

        "Template" (TT2/Template ToolKit) is only required if you plan on
        using Handel within TT2 based websites.

  Build/Test Modules

    The following modules are only required for the test suite when running
    "make test".

    Test::More
        "Test::More" version 0.48 or greater.

        The "Test::More" included with perl 5.8.4 and "Test::More" <= 0.48
        have issues with ithreads that usually cause crashes in tests that
        use "Class::DBI" or "DBIx:ContextualFetch". The errors usual mention
        "attempt to free unreferenced scalar". If you reveive these during
        "make test", try upgrading "Test::More".

    Pod::Coverage
        "Pod::Coverage" version 0.14 or greater.

        The pod coverage tests may fail complaining about missing pod for
        methods if Pod::Coverage < 0.14 is installed. This is due to certain
        syntax variations of the pod with escaped gt/lt. I may just alter
        the pod and bump this version down if there is enough feedback to do
        so.

    Test::Pod
        "Test::Pod" version 1.00 or greater.

        "Test::Pod" 1.00 added the "all_pod_files_ok()" method which makes
        my life easier. :-)

    Test::Pod::Coverage
        "Test::Pod::Coverage" version 1.04 or greater.

        "Test::Pod::Coverage" 1.04 was made taint safe, and we run the tests
        with -wT like good girls and boys.

    Test:Strict
        "Test::Strict" version 0.01 or greater.

        This keeps me honest and makes sure I always "use strict".
