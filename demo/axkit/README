This is a quick little demo using the AxKit::XSP::Handel::Cart taglib
within AxKit to create, add to, update, and delete from a shopping cart.

To run this demo, you will need to have already installed DBD::SQlite,
AxKit and the following Taglibs:

	AxKit::XSP::Cookie
	AxKit::XSP::Param

If you have DBD::SQLite installed, simply run t/demo/createdb.pl
to create the database used by default. If you would like use another database,
you should be able to run t/sql/cart_create_table.sql against the database of
your choosing to create the require schema. Make sure to change
httpd.conf.include to reflect the correct db_name, db_driver, etc. See the
Handel::DBI docs for all of the database connection variables available.

To setup the Handel shopping cart demo, just include httpd.conf.include
in your existing httpd.conf file like so:

	Include /path/to/this/httpd.conf.include

Don't forget to change DocumentRoot, ErrorLog, db_name and 'use lib' to
match your system configuration and the installation of Handel.
